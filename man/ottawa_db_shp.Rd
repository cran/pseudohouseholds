\description{
Spatial dataset for dissemination blocks (DBs) in Ottawa, Ontario, provided by
Statistics Canada, \url{https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/boundary-limites/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21}.
}
\details{
Dissemination blocks are the smallest unit of geography at which Statistics
Canada publishes population data. DBs are generally bounded by road segments
or natural features like waterways. In urban areas DBs are generally the size
of a city block, but in rural areas they can be much larger.
